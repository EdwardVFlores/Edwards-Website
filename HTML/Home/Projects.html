                <h3>What are your projects?</h3>
                <p>Usually I make a lot of projects but I only decided to post my top 3 projects / experiences that I believe brought out the most value in my work. Which of now is creating discord bots, making roblox games, and solving programming challenges.</p>
                <h2>How did you choose each project?</h2>
                <h3>Discord Bots</h3>
                <p>I believed this taught me how to hook up apis and this is really usefull in my life that I use regularly.</p>
                <h3>Roblox Games</h3>
                <p>Making roblox games lets me learn how to deal with community members that want to help my games grow.</p>
                <h3>Programming Challenges</h3>
                <p>Doing these programming challenges really enhances and teaches me how to organize and process data.</p>
                <h3>What inspired you to make projects in the first place?</h3>
                <p>I think coding is really fun for me, I think of myself as a creator and being able to make things come to life and also working with technology is really cool to me.</p>

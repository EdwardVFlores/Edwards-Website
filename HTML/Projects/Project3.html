                <h3>What is Competitive Programming?</h3>
                <p>Given a problem statement a person must use their knowledge of coding to solve real world problems. People are usually given input and within their code they have to match output.</p>
                <h3>Who can compete in these competitions?</h3>
                <p>The contest that I have competed in only have college students competing in them but this is a e-sport that is globally known to programmers. And some of these questions can come up in jobs for interview questions.</p>

                <h3>When did you start competitive programming?</h3>
                <p>I started competitive programming around 2019 and is also the time where I won my first programming competition in division 2.</p>
                <h3>Why is this considered important to you?</h3>
                <p>Solving these problems in programming helps out my coding skills a lot, I need to know Data Structures and Algorithms to solve these types of problems.</p>
                <img id="Project3Img" src="../../Img/Projects/Project3/medal.jpg" alt="A photo about project 3">
                <h3>Did you stop practicing problems ever since you won?</h3>
                <p>No I believe that a person always can learn something new in the world of computer science which is why I looked into other websites that also do competitive programming.</p>
                <img id="Project1Img" src="../../Img/Projects/Project3/leetcode.png" alt="A photo about project 3">
                <p>This is a picture of my leetcode statistics, I started practicing coding problems for interview problems, these types of problems are presented at big tech companies so learning how to solve them teaches me a lot.</p>

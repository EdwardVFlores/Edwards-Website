                <p>A screenshot of community members joining a group that had all my games in it.</p>
                <h3>Main Purpose?</h3>
                <p>Most of my games that I make is for entertainment and to learn how to manage projects. Making games built a community where I could get feedback and also learn on what I can improve on.</p>
                <h3>Technologies?</h3>
                <p>Roblox Studio, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Blender, Photoshop</p>
                <h3>Languages Used?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li style= "margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Lua</li>

                <p>A picture of multiple games that I have made on the platform.</p>
                <h3>Why make Roblox Games?</h3>
                <p>When I was young I was always a builder, I always had a passion to create. But I didn't know where to start so Roblox was a game I found that was designed for users to create games.</p>
                <h3>Benefits?</h3>
                <p>Usually for entertainment purposes most of my games aren't really there to educate and just for fun. Helps people with hand eye coordination and also being able to connect with other users of this game engine.</p>
